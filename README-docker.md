Install Docker (docker engine and docker-compose).

- Windows (recommended way)
  - [Docker for Win 10 (includes both docker engine and docker-compose)](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)
  - Docker Desktop installer 
    - first step - keep both checkboxes checked
    - After the restart, the `WSL 2 installation is incomplete.` window will appear 
      - Follow instructions on the website linked in the popup window
      - click `Restart` / restart Docker desktop
